## Navigating the Code
* Code for models can be found in [dkm/models](dkm/models/)
* Code for benchmarks can be found in [dkm/benchmarks](dkm/benchmarks/)
* Code for reproducing experiments from our paper can be found in [experiments/](experiments/)

## Install
Run ``pip install -e .``

## Demo
**Currently broken!**

A demonstration of our method can be run by:
``` bash
python demo_match.py
```
This runs our model trained on mega on two images I took recently in the wild.

## Benchmarks
See [Benchmarks](docs/benchmarks.md) for details.
## Training
See [Training](docs/training.md) for details.
## Reproducing Results
Given that the required benchmark or training dataset has been downloaded and unpacked, results can be reproduced by running the experiments in the experiments folder.
